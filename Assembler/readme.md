# Mock Assembler


## Project Overview

This C program evaluates assembly instructions (`add`, `sub`, `and`, `beq`, `lw`, `sw`, and `j`), performs their given operation, and places the binary result in a .dat file. It does so primarily using masks and bitshifting


## Execution Instructions

To start, you'll need to clone this repository into your current directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/marksheldon2/marksheldonrepo.git
```

Once you've navigated into the repository folder, navigate into the `Assembler` directory:
```console
cd Assembler
```

When you're in the Assembler directory, you can simply type `make run` and the program will compile and run. Output is generated by `assembler.c` from the assembly instructions listed in `abc.s` and is placed in the `output.dat` file.
