# Repository Overview

## About Me
Hi, I'm Mark! I’m a driven software engineer with a strong foundation in software engineering and **hands-on experience** in numerous languages, including C/C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I'm all about **working with real people to solve real business problems**.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have extensive leadership experience that has honed my ability to collaborate with others, navigate high-pressure environments, and guide teams to mission-driven success. Beyond code, I’m a **passionate learner** who's most likely to be found practicing my trumpet, playing piano, or out running a trail.

## Repo Guide
I've organized the repo based on project name. Within each project folder will be the code and any supporting materials related (diagrams, test cases, etc), as well as a readme with an overview of the project and any execution instructions. Happy reading!
