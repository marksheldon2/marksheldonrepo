# Golf Course Updater using GPS and GeoJSON Polygons


## Project Overview
This project was completed by a 5-person team of Clemson students collaborating with top sports tech company and official PGA partner, Arccos. Arccos' primary business efforts revolve around their mobile golf caddie app that tracks shot and play data, offering real-time stats and data summaries to help golfers shoot lower scores. My team and I were tasked with brainstorming, designing, and implementing a solution to streamline the correction of errors in their mapping database of more than 40,000 golf courses worldwide. We chose to develop a support ticket flow that could be used by Arccos users to submit a GeoJSON outline of a golf feature (tee box, green, bunker, etc) that is inaccurately marked in Arccos’ system. Once integrated with Arccos’ app, our efforts will save Arccos hundreds of hours of time spent manually remapping courses using on text-based support tickets.


## Project Details
- Written in Typescript
- Developed and tested using React Native's Expo
- Utilized Agile framework (weekly sprints, deliverable presentations, and standups with lead Arccos engineers)


## Where is the Code?
Because the code my group and I wrote could end up in Arccos' production codebase, we're bound by an NDA to not be able to share it. You'll have to take my word for it that it was really great and you would be super impressed.
